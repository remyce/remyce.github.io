    <p>Hello, I’m Remyce,  a front-end web developer and designer based in London.</p>

    <p>Having studied Interactive Art and Design, I’ve always had a love for the arts and technology.  I first began coding through editing CMS (Content Management System) themes such as Tumblr.  I wanted to delve further into Web Development  in order to build useful but life changing web applications.  So after a few online coding courses, I attended a three month coding bootcamp. This pushed me out of my comfort zone quicker than Sheldon realising someone was sitting in his sofa spot. Nevertheless it was the challenge I was searching for.</p>

    <p>I would like to work with a collaborative team where I’ll be exposed to both creative direction and software development. I am currently studying a BA in Creative Arts part-time and available for full time work or internships. </p>

    <p>Disclaimer</p>
    <p>This website was designed and built by Remyce Savanna. All work shown is by me unless otherwise stated.</p>
