    <p>Hello, I’m Remyce,  a front-end web developer, designer and student based in London.</p>

    <p>Having studied Interactive Art and Design, I’ve always had a love for the arts and technology.  I first began coding through editing Tumblr themes. From then I knew I wanted to delve further into Web Development to build useful but life changing web applications. After a few online coding courses,  I attended a three month coding bootcamp. This pushed me out of my comfort zone quicker than Sheldon realising someone was sitting in his sofa spot. Nevertheless it was the challenge I was searching for.</p>

    <p>I am currently studying a BA in Creative Arts (part-time) and available for full time work and internships.  Want to chat, collaborate? <a href="mailto:remycesavanna@gmail.com">Contact me.</a></p>
