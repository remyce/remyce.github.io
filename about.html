      Aloha, I'm Remyce!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, I'm not sunning it up in Hawaii but I can dream right!?
      Speaking of dreams...once upon a time I worked in fashion retail. It was fun;
      I enjoyed visual merchandising but I felt that I needed to explore my
      creativity in a new way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had studied Interactive Art & Design before, which was where my love for
      creative technology evolved. A few online coding courses later, I then decided
      to immerse myself in the world of web development at General Assembly. Which
      I found both challenging and rewarding to say the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now? Well...I enjoy combining art with code and being a lifelong learner.
      I am a junior Front-End Web Developer and part-time Creative Arts student based
      in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently available for internships and full time work.
      Want to collaborate? Grab a few drinks? Or just say Hi? <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me!
